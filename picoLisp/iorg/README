         The PicoLisp Iorg
         =================

To explore the PicoLisp Iorg, install an up-to-date PicoLisp system (as an OS
distribution package, or from http://software-lab.de/down.html), and unpack the
tarballs "iorg.tgz" (http://software-lab.de/iorg.tgz) and
"socialshareprivacy.tgz" (http://software-lab.de/socialshareprivacy.tgz) in some
convenient place.

"iorg.tgz" will go into a "iorg/" subdirectory, and "socialshareprivacy.tgz"
will expand in "lib/" (for the social share privacy buttons, you need jQuery 1.4
or greater).

Then run it as

   $ pil iorg/main.l -main -go +

This will start the server, and create another subdirectory, "db/iorg/",
containing a minimal database setup.


The server listens at port 5000, so you can point your browser to

   http://localhost:5000

or, if you have 'httpGate' running, to

   http://localhost/5000

In both cases, you'll see the iorg application GUI (officially at
http://iorg.picolisp.com). Log in as user "admin" and password "admin".

On the console, the PicoLisp prompt ':' appears.


The initial database contains two roles ("Administrator" and "Member"), a single
user ("admin"), and three documents ("help", "menu" and "home").

A click on the "Iorg" link on the top left switches to the iorg website view
(officially at http://home.picolisp.com), and from there "My account" will bring
you back into the application GUI.

As ever, the debug session (the server's child process handling the current GUI
session) can be terminated with Ctrl-D. If this is followed by Ctrl-C, the
server (parent) process will terminate too.
