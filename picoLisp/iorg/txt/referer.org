Org-mode and PicoLisp are my two favorite pieces of software, thus I decided
to write the glue code that merges both softwares into one single - extremely
powerful - application programming framework.

I don't remember how I first learned about Emacs, but learning Elisp,
discovering Org-mode, and finally falling in love with PicoLisp were just
logical steps in the same direction. 

Since progress often emerges at the interface between already existing
technologies, I hope that iOrg is more than just the sum of PicoLisp and
Org-mode - in this case, the much abused term /synergy effects/ seems adequate
to describe the extra benefits offered by iOrg.
