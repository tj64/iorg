* Org-mode Markup Syntax

Org-mode Markup has a relatively simple syntax. Some of its most basic
elements are listed below, for an in-debt coverage please consult the manuals.

These and quite a lot other markup types are supported:

# Levels 1 .. 8 are allowed
** Heading                #  Heading (level 3)

Some /italic/ words mixed with *bold* words look nice, while  _underlined_
text is a bit overkill sometimes. An unordered list like

# Unordered list
  - List item 1            #   List items
  - List item 2

or an ordered list like

# Ordered list
  1. List item 1            #  List items
  2. List item 2

look nice too.
