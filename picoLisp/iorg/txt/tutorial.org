* Exploring iOrg

This tutorial try's to give you an impression of what iOrg is all about by
demonstrating its use from a users perspective (web-browser) as well as from a
power-users (Emacs as client) and programmers point of view.

It has 5 Parts:

   1. ={assumpt Assumptions}
   2. ={webUI Web UI}
   3. ={emacsUI Emacs UI}
   4. ={picoDB PicoLisp Database}
   5. ={dhtmlMup Markup for DHTML}

Please note that *iOrg* is still in a relatively /early/ development stage,
besides the fact that both underlying systems, *PicoLisp* as well as *GNU
Emacs Org-mode*, are seasoned and production-ready software products.
Therefore, in some occasions, the tutorial rather sketches the possibilities
of iOrg than showing a full-fledged implementation.
